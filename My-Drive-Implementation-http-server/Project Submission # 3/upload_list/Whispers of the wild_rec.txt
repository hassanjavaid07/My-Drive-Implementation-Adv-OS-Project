**Whispers of the Wild**

In the hush of morning's glow,
Where the first light soft and low,
Kisses dew on blades of green,
Nature wakes in silent sheen.

Whispers of the wild arise,
Beneath the canvas of the skies,
Birdsong weaves a melody,
A symphony in harmony.

Rivers dance on rocky beds,
Sunlight crowns their rippled heads,
Trees with ancient arms embrace,
The gentle breeze, a soft caress.

Mountains stand, their shoulders high,
Guardians of the azure sky,
Veils of mist and shadows play,
In the dawning light of day.

Petals bloom in vibrant hues,
Bathed in drops of morning dew,
Bees in golden, busy flight,
Gather nectar in delight.

Waves upon the sandy shore,
Whisper tales of evermore,
Secrets from the ocean’s heart,
In their rhythmic ebb, impart.

Underneath the starry dome,
Creatures call the forest home,
Nighttime brings a lullaby,
Crickets sing, the owls reply.

Nature’s pulse, a steady beat,
In every corner, small and sweet,
From tallest peak to deepest sea,
It breathes with life, wild and free.

So listen close, and you will hear,
The timeless song both far and near,
A world alive in every part,
Nature's poem to the heart.
